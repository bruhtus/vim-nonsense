# nonsense.vim

Nonsense is a vim colorscheme that doesn't make sense. A combination of [kuroi.vim](https://github.com/aonemd/kuroi.vim) and [seoul256.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/seoul256.vim) that doesn't match at all, hence the name **nonsense**.

Nonsense was made with [vim-colortemplate plugin](https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate) so you can edit nonsense with those plugin, manually inside the script, or replace the existing highlight like usual.
